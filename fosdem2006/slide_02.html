<h1>The "Big Bang"</h1>

<div class="explanation">
<ul class="timeline">
 <li><b>March 2005</b>:
  <ul>
   <li>IRC and news discussions had led to staff discussing the suite's
     future, and get stirred up even more due to
     <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=4229F899.5060002%40mozilla.org">recent
     staff meeting minutes</a> that make clear that Mozilla Foundation wants to cease
     suite development, some developers don't like that</li>
   <li>March 10, 10am PST:
    <ul>
     <li>After discussion with some strong supporters on IRC, Boris Zbarsky ("bz")
       posts an <a href="http://web.mit.edu/bzbarsky/Public/SeaMonkey.txt">open
       letter to mozilla.org staff</a></li>
     <li>"We are assuming that the Mozilla Foundation does not in fact plan to
        have a Mozilla Suite release based on Gecko 1.8"</li>
     <li>"In brief, we <span class="hilite">propose a development model similar
       to that which Camino has</span> right now."</li>
     <li>"Any release based on this development effort [...] is not branded as
       the "Mozilla Suite"."</li>
    </ul>
   <li>March 10 - almost 1pm PST (!):
    <ul>
     <li><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/seamonkey-transition.html">Transition
       plan</a> published by mozilla.org</li>
     <li>Mozilla 1.7.x "will be the last set of Seamonkey products released and
       maintained by the Mozilla Foundation"</li>
     <li>"The Mozilla Foundation will provide infrastructure support [...] for
       community members who wish to continue to develop Seamonkey."</li>
     <li>Pointing to bz's letter: "<span class="hilite">We support this plan</span>
       and will work with interested parties to figure out strategy."</li>
     <li>"The dedication to the product, the initiative of the developers and
       the proposal of the transition plan as a solution are all hallmarks of
       the Mozilla community. We support this effort completely."</li>
     <li>While press and public see the end of Mozilla suite as main point,
       the core SeaMonkey developer community sees support for new project
       as the most important message</li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>Following weeks:
    <ul>
     <li>signers of bz's letter and other supporters work together, mainly on
       IRC, to organize the new project and get it
       started</li>
     <li><span class="hilite">Neil, biesi, IanN, CTho and KaiRo</span>
       agree to take part in the new project's steering comitee, later dubbed the
       "<span class="hilite"><a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/SeaMonkey:Project_Organization#SeaMonkey_Council">SeaMonkey
       Council</a></span>".</li>
    </ul>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ul>
