<!-- MAIN CONTENT -->
<p>This is the <strong><?php echo $project; ?></strong> project @ mozdev.org.</p>

<p>The project contains some scripts and smaller OSS programs by me (Robert Kaiser, a.k.a. "KaiRo").</p>

<p>Most of those scripts and/or programs have some connection to
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a>, but I'll eventually also provide some software that
has no direct connection to my favourite browser.</p>

<p>For wishes and comments about the project and software please use Bugzilla, I'm already overburdened
with personal mail, so I perhaps won't get to answer that sooner or later, but I'll look at Bugzilla
often enough to work at open bug reports.
<br>See the "bugs" link in the navigation line above.</p>
