<h1>The Year Of Change</h1>

<div class="explanation">
A year ago, we saw hope that L10n will get a bit more focus from mozilla.org staff (but not a lot of action happening yet),
MLP staff was more or less deserted (one member left who was hardly available), Firefox was quite new, Mozilla Europe even more.
<br>Within a year, lots of things changed:
<ul class="timeline">
 <li><b>February 2004</b>:
  <ul>
   <li><a href="http://www.mozilla-europe.org/">Mozilla Europe</a> launched,
       having a <span class="hilite">multi-language web site</span> and promising to help L10n efforts.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li><b>March 2004</b>:
  <ul>
   <li>Mozilla Europe offered to build up <span class="hilite">automated build systems</span> for localized Mozilla installers.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li><b>April 2004</b>:
  <ul>
   <li>Andrea, the last, not very responsive guy to upload builds to mozilla.org, asked me to join <span class="hilite">MLP staff</span>.
       All attempts to do so failed though (mail server config problem).
       BTW, that was the last time we heard of Andrea.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li><b>June 2004</b>:
  <ul>
   <li>Mozilla Foundation organized a first <span class="hilite">IRC meeting for localizers</span>.</li>
   <li><span class="hilite">Benjamin Smedberg</span> started to work on getting Firefox (branch) L10n into some good order and CVS-based.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li><b>July 2004</b>:
  <ul>
   <li>After Andrea had been gone entirely, I got <span class="hilite">FTP staging</span> and website CVS access at the end of the month.
       Uploading of localized builds to mozilla.org did start again, after we didn't have any new builds there for a while.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li><b>August 2004</b>:
  <ul>
   <li>I opened a bug report requesting for volunteers for <span class="hilite">re-grouping MLP staff</span>.
       staff@mozilla.org did agree to our plans of regrouping that team and some people did actually volunteer.
       We started talking of what responsibilites who wants to take and who will get the team leader.
       At the end of the month, I actually got into mlp-staff@mozilla.org list after myk investigated the server problems.</li>
   <li>Localization <span class="hilite">trademark policies</span> for Firefox and Thunderbird were worked on, including input from Mozilla Europe and me.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li><b>September 2004</b>:
  <ul>
   <li>Benjamin got <span class="hilite">L10n CVS</span> set up at a new CVSROOT, creating of accounts started.</li>
   <li>The <span class="hilite">new MLP staff team</span> got into shape, the members agreed that I should lead the team.
       Slowly, over the next months, people got the accounts (staging, website CVS) they need for their tasks and started working in those areas.</li>
   <li>Localization trademark policies got finished and published.</li>
   <li>At the end of the month, we started regular <span class="hilite">L10n phone meetings</span> with focus on FF/TB 1.0 releases.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li><b>October 2004</b>:
  <ul>
   <li>The <span class="hilite">automated build process for Firefox</span> was heavily being worked on and took on more and more shape,
       Mozilla Europe offered to host international pages (those linked of the FF start page) for all over the world (registering  <a href="http://www.mozilla-world.org/">mozilla-world.org</a> for that),
       <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/start-snippets/">snippets</a> for those start pages were invented to make the (at this point confidential) <a href="http://start.mozilla.org/firefox">Google start pages</a> possible.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li><b>November 2004</b>:
  <ul>
   <li>In the beginning of the month, we got our hands full with localized pages coming in to be hosted by Mozilla Europe,
       getting start page snippets into the tree, and localizations ready for shipping (e.g. signing off by trademark policy).
       <span class="hilite">Firefox 1.0 was released simultaneously in 15 languages</span> with more to follow (rising to 28 until January).</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li><b>December 2004</b>:
  <ul>
   <li>In another big effort, we managed to get <span class="hilite">Thunderbird released in 12 languages</span>, with some following shortly afterwards.
       As a CVS-based approach wasn't available, all builds made by volunteers had to be tested and signed off at MF by Asa/Sarah/Chase.</li>
   <li>MLP staff started monthly <span class="hilite">IRC meetings</span>.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li><b>January 2005</b>:
  <ul>
   <li>The <span class="hilite">L10n team registration</span> process was revamped to use Bugzilla instead of mails.</li>
   <li><span class="hilite">Zbigniew Braniecki (gandalf)</span>, who did lots of approvals for L10n checkins, was invited to phone meetings evolving around 1.1 releases.
       He started to work on getting trunk ready for using "source L10n", the new CVS-based approach.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li><b>February 2005</b>:
  <ul>
   <li><span class="hilite">Firefox trunk localization</span> is getting to work, gandalf is working on getting it to work for Thunderbird next.</li>
   <li><span class="hilite">Firefox 1.0.1/1.0.2</span> should get released in 40 languages simulaneously.</li>
   <li>Ideas for <span class="hilite">restructuring of MLP web pages</span> are taking shape, the mess should get cleaned up soon.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ul>
